        <p>üë®‚Äçüíª Hi there! I'm Shaniah Nyabawa, a passionate student currently pursuing my studies in programming. 
            <br>My journey into the world of coding began with a curiosity to understand how technology works and a desire to create innovative solutions to real-world problems.
            <br>Throughout my academic journey, I have delved deep into programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, honing my skills in web development, data structures, and algorithms. 
            <br>I find joy in the process of translating ideas into elegant lines of code that can bring about meaningful change.
            <br>
            <br>When I'm not immersed in the world of programming, you can find me exploring new technologies, collaborating on exciting projects, or seeking inspiration from the vibrant tech community. 
            <br>Apart from that, I would be either drawing, singing, dancing or with my family. Those are a few things among the things I love doing during my free time.
            <br>My ultimate goal is to leverage my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact in the ever-evolving realm of technology.
            <br>Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities that the world of programming has to offer! Feel free to reach out for collaborations, discussions, or simply to geek out about all things tech. 
            <br>Excited to see where this coding journey takes us!üåü

        <p>Maseru, the capital and largest city of Lesotho, lies on the western border with South Africa, nestled amidst picturesque mountains along the Caledon River. Notable for the Lesotho Parliament Building on parliament hill, this spot serves as a crucial hub for political activities, embodying the country's democratic governance.</p>
